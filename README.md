# Event Management and Ticketing System

## Overview

This project is a scalable event management and ticketing system built using a microservices architecture. It allows users to create events, manage tickets, and receive notifications.

## Architecture

The system is divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

- **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Event Service**: Handles event creation, updates, and listings.
- **Ticket Service**: Manages ticket sales, availability, and reservations.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about events and ticket purchases.

## Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application built with [Your Chosen Framework] that interacts with the backend services via RESTful APIs.

## Backend

Each microservice is an independent application with its own database and API endpoints. The services communicate with each other over HTTP or messaging queues.

## API Endpoints
