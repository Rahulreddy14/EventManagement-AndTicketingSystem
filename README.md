# üöÄ Event Management and Ticketing System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Event Management and Ticketing System**, a scalable solution built using a microservices architecture. This project allows users to create events, manage tickets, and receive notifications seamlessly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built using the **MERN Stack**:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user, event, and ticket information.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend services.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface of the frontend application.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to build the backend services.

## Architecture

The system is divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

- **User Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Event Service**: Handles event creation, updates, and listings.
- **Ticket Service**: Manages ticket sales, availability, and reservations.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about events and ticket purchases.

## Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application built with **React** that interacts with the backend services via RESTful APIs.

## Backend

Each microservice is an independent application with its own database and API endpoints. The services communicate with each other over HTTP or messaging queues.
